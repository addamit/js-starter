# js-starter
starter project for javascript with useful tooling

Modern javascript has tons of tooling requirements. This project has a few starter configuration that helps me get started.
1. Live code reloading 
2. Code bundling 
3. ES6 syntax support 
4. Code linting 
5. Minification 

# How to get started
```
git clone https://github.com/addamit/js-starter
npm init .
npm start dev 
```
This should open a local webpage with live code reloading. Start editing code in index.js under src folder to see changes
